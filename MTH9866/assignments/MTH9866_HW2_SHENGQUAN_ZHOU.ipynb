    "Tenor of the forward contract adds another dimension. Risk management is more complex for FX forwards than for FX spot because not all trades are fungible with each other across the forward curve, like the spot. In the broker market for inter-dealer trades, only benchmark tenors are traded, while clients can trade any settlement date they like. It's unlikely for a client to want to buy exactly the benchmark tenor or the same tenor forward that another client wanted to sell."

We assume two benchmark dates, $T_1$ = 0.25y and $T_2$ = 1y; we will use forwards to those settlement dates to hedge the forward rate risk (or equivalently, the risk to moves in the asset currency interest rate) of our portfolio.\n",

    "\n",
    "The portfolio to hedge has one position: a unit asset-currency notional of a forward contract settling at time $T$. You’ll try this for values of $T$ in [0.1,0.25,0.5,0.75,1,2] to see how performance changes for portfolios with risk to different tenors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will try three different hedging strategies: one where you choose the hedge notionals (of forwards settling at times $T_1$ and $T_2$) based on the triangle shock we discussed in class (though as there are only two benchmarks here, the T1 shock will be flat before $T_1$ and the $T_2$ shock will be flat after $T_2$); one where the notionals are set to hedge the actual two shocks from the factors described above; and lastly, one where you don’t hedge at all.\n",

    "2. Add in the hedges: two forwards, settling at times $T_1$ and $T_2$, with notionals set to hedge the portfolio (either against the two triangle shocks or against the two factor shocks). Don’t bother adding the hedges in the third hedge scenario where we leave the portfolio unhedged.\n",
    "3. Simulate the portfolio forward a time $dt=0.001\\text{y}$. That will result in the asset-currency rates moving according to the factor model described above, which shocks the benchmark rates for tenors $T_1$ and $T_2$, and for the portfolio’s risk tenor T. Determine the PNL realized. \n",

    "Hedging by triangular shocks achieves an excellent efficiency (>0.98) for $T_1\\le T\\le T_2$, reasonable (~0.93) for $T<T_1$, but poorly (~0.64) for $T>T_2$. This means that the simple triangular model is a fairly good model as long as the benchmark tenors used in hedging cover the target range of settling dates in the portfolio. The reason for this performance decline approaching the curve backend is that the assumption of forward curve moving in parallel in the backend (from 1y outward) is unrealistic. In fact, the backend of the forward curve responds to a less extent to the shocks than the front end does. More realistically, the 2y tenor will move less than the 1y tenor. As a consequence, the triangular shock model over-estimates the hedging notional on 1y tenor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The factor model hedging essentially offsets all movements in $Q(T)$ (>0.9999). This is expected because the shocks are hedged in exactly the same way they are generated, according to the 2-factor stochastic differential equations."
